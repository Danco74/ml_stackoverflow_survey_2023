Stack Overflow Survey Analysis
This project is my first machine learning project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It involves analyzing Stack Overflow survey data to explore factors affecting developer satisfaction and salary trends.

Project Structure
notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
survey_results_public.csv: The dataset with survey responses.
survey_results_schema.csv: The schema detailing the survey questions.
Description
In this project, I used Python with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and Plotly to answer three key questions related to developer satisfaction and compensation. This analysis helps identify trends and insights into the factors that influence developer experiences and earnings.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Library for machine learning and predictive modeling.
Plotly: Library for interactive data visualizations.
Usage
To explore the analysis, open the notebook.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset files (survey_results_public.csv and survey_results_schema.csv) are used within the notebook for analysis.
